# homelab-setup
Hello! This will be my documentation for setting up a homelab with the express purpose for training to be a SOC Analyist. Currently a 1st Year BSIT student and most of this is new to me so I will learn much as I go.
Started with downloading Oracle Virtual Box since it's free and apparently best for beginners.
Downloaded Win11 ISO from "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11". This will be my "victim" machine with logs and user activity.
Downloaded Kali Linux from "https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms" This will be for learning an attackers perspective, packet capture and and analysis tools
Downladed Ubuntu Server from "https://ubuntu.com/download/server" And lastly this will act as a log forwarder or a mock server (e.g., web server).
