# homelab-setup
Greetings! I'm Saint

I'm a 1st-year BSIT student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, especially in becoming a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst.  

This GitHub is where I document my journey â€” from foundational labs and scripting exercises to SOC-related tools and projects.  

ðŸ’» Currently learning:
- Networking fundamentals  
- Security concepts and incident response  
- Setting up my own cybersecurity homelab
